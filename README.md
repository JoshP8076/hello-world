First repository as I explore GitHub
I like military tanks, mostly those that are from the Second World War.
The Panzerkampfwagen VI, or the "Tiger" tank as it was nicknamed, was created in 1942 and presented to Germany's Fuhrer as a birthday gift. It was created earlier than the Panzerkampfwagen V, or the "Panther" tank, which is influenced by the Russian T-34s and was made as a direct response to it. The call for the tanks were made as a result of the end of the German Blitzkrieg.
